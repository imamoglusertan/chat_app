# chat_app

A basic chat app that I developed while watching the Firebase tutorial. But I can use it (so can you) as a template so I'm uploading it to save my progress. Feel free to use it!

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter chat/social media application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
